Hello everyone! My name is Connor McCune and I am very excited to be joining the OMDS community! I have worked for Trex Company for the last three years in Winchester VA. My undergraduate is in chemical engineering from Iowa State University and I started my career as a process engineer, working with large amounts of data to troubleshoot and identify problems. My goal in this program is to identify ways that I can use the real-time data that we are collecting from our equipment every second (amps, rpm, product dimensions, etc.) and apply machine learning models for anomaly detection, parameter recommendations, and automation.

Outside of work, my hobbies include: traveling (and planning trips), hiking, backpacking, disc golf, cooking, and skiing.
